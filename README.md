Garikai Gijima helped me on Teams to convert hexadecimal strings to integers.
Professor Sam Rebelsky also demonstrated a method of converting to Unicode in class.

Note: I can't get the unicode characters to show up on my laptop. So I am just hoping they will show up when it's being graded. If not, I have no other guesses on how to fix it. Also, "dump" doesn't show up as working in the test class but if you actually call it it looks right. That is why I made the static method 
"dumpAll()" in BrailleASCIITables.java, for easy visual testing of it.
